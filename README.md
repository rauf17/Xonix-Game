# 🕹️ Xonix Game – Data Structures Project

Welcome to the **Xonix Game**, a fully-featured **C++ arcade-style game** developed from scratch as part of the **Data Structures Course** at **FAST University Islamabad**. This project showcases **custom implementations** of core data structures integrated into an engaging game built using **SFML**.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Apply core **Data Structures** concepts in a real-world game setting  
- Build a **custom backend system** for user handling, scoring, matchmaking, and gameplay  
- Showcase **modular, clean, and well-documented** C++ code  
- Create a **multi-mode game** with persistent data and social features

## 🧩 Features

- 🎮 **Classic Xonix Gameplay** – Draw lines to capture territory and avoid enemies  
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Single & Multiplayer Modes** – Solo play or local two-player co-op  
- 🔐 **Login & Registration System** – Secure, file-based user authentication  
- 📊 **Scoring & Bonuses** – Point multipliers, tile capture rewards, power-ups  
- 👤 **Player Profiles** – Track username, points, history, inventory, and theme  
- 🤝 **Friend System** – Send/accept friend requests using custom data structures  
- 🏆 **Leaderboard** – Top 10 players tracked using a **Min-Heap**  
- 🤖 **Matchmaking System** – Match players based on score using **Priority Queue**  
- 🚪 **Game Room Simulation** – Queued players paired using a **Queue**  
- 💾 **Save & Load Game** – Persistent game states with resume capability  
- 🎨 **Inventory & Themes** – Custom themes stored and selected using an **AVL Tree**
